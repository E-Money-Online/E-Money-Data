As a counselor, you help the people who are emotionally damaged and becoming pessimistic. \n\nWhat is online counseling? \n\nAs name suggests, online counseling is a kind of online provided mental health service. You take counseling sessions with your clients over email, text chat, or video chat. Earlier, it was linked with face-to face traditional therapy, but now it is a service that can stand-alone. \n\nRequirements: \n\nTo be an online counselor you need some training first, and this training varies from person to person. As this field is relatively new, no country has proper guidelines for opting this career. That means it is up to you to be in charge of your education. Apparently, you would need the same degree as the real-world counselor. The most important thing is having the knowledge if you really need to help your clients and make them confident about your counseling skills. \n\nHow much money does an online counselor can make? \n\nThe money an online counselor makes depends on the qualification and ability one have. If you are new in the field, you cannot expect as much as the person having ten years\u2019 experience can. If an experienced one is making $100,000 annually, you can expect somewhere between $30,000 and $50,000. Moreover, as you are working independently online, you have the power to set prices of your own choices, which means you have more control over your income than a real-world counselor does.  \n\nHow to get started? \n\nAs you are doing it online so first thing, essentially, you need is a webpage. If you don\u2019t have much experience with web designing, then you can hire a website developer who can do it for you in more professional way. Then you will need to advertise and market your site so that more and more people can approach you. You can do it via social media posts and blogs. If you are supposed to go with face-to-face sessions i.e. video sessions then you will need a proper setup, it can be your room with proper lights. \n\nWhy should you opt this career? \n\nYou should join this career because more people are willing to take online counseling rather than traditional counseling, because of; \n\nAccessibility \u2013 This service is easily accessible to the people who are jobholders, work for hours, and do not have enough time to go to counselors physically, the people who cannot leave their homes i.e. single parents, ill people etc. \n\nAffordability \u2013 It is affordable for both you and client. It is affordable for you because you don\u2019t have to pay for an office rent. For client because they don\u2019t have to spend money on travel/commuting. It is lower-cost and has the ability to reach the patients who might not otherwise seek treatment. \n\nConvenience \u2013 You and your client can take a session any time, whenever it suits you both. You are not restricted to time to close/open your office as you are, in case of real-world offices. \n\nSecurity/Privacy  \u2013 Clients feel more relaxed while expressing themselves out, when the communication is in non-visual form. It also lowers the shame of race, age and body appearance. \n\nHow to market your service? \n\nSearch engine optimization is the best option for targeting more audience. All you need to do is to use appropriate Keywords for your website content. Moreover, beyond online world you can advertise your services in real world too.  Just don\u2019t stop tooting the horn! \n\nWebsites for Online Counseling Jobs: \n\nAll the websites have their own criteria of qualification for hiring an online counselor.

Many people are not easily convicted for traditional forms of counseling because of the social stigma associated with seeking help, so online counseling provides them a service that can address a currently unmet need. In addition, within the last decade, the number of online counseling services have been increased very rapidly. Only time can tell us the fate of online counseling, but from all accounts, it appears that it is becoming more popular and widely accepted as the time passes. \n\nBETTER LUCK!

It is quite true! If you have a quality content based website domain and you get a lot of traffic there then for sure, you can make decent money from it. \n\nFor better understanding, let me ask you a question. Have you ever heard about backlinks? If no, then this article will help you a lot in this! \n\nWhat are backlinks? \n\nBacklinks are the links on a website that directs you back to another website or page. These links are like traffic signboards that lead you throughout your web traveling. If we say, your website is selling the backlinks; it means your site is the one that is doing the linking. \n\nWhy would people pay you? \n\nBeing on internet and having websites on internet is useless until those websites don\u2019t manage to appear on search engine. Therefore, all this game is of search engine optimization (SEO).  If your website has good quality content, has good search engine ranking and you can easily attract a big traffic to your website then people will pay you for placing their backlinks on your website. Because when someone links to another person website, it shows to Google that their website is worth linking to, so Google will give it preference for their search engine placements. \n\nHow your site gets on search engine? \n\nGoogle ranks a site on two most important things, the content on the site and the links pointing to the sites\n\nThe two most important things deciding how Google ranks a site are: \n\n 1. content on the site\n\n 2. the links pointing to the site\n\nWhy the link/backlinks are so important? \n\nLinks are like votes. They indicate others to \u2018go there\u2019 on the site. However, the sheer number of links is not the only factor that matters for website\u2019s SEO. The other most important factor is the \u201cQuality of the link(s)\u201d. \n\nIf you want your link to be stand out for SEO purpose, it must be relevant to the website\u2019s content. The niche of the website on which the link is placed and the niche of the website on which the link(s) land(s) us must be relevant. \n\nRequirements: \n\nYou don\u2019t need any special degree or courses for this job. All you need is a well-established website and quality content that readers find valuable. \n\nHow much can you earn? \n\nHow much money can you make depends on many factors, such as\n\n\u2022 Domain authority of your website\n\n\u2022 The traffic of your website\n\n\u2022 The number of backlinks you sell\n\n\u2022 The ranking of your site on SEO\n\nAs a Backlinks seller, you will earn monthly reoccurring revenue for each link that an advertiser chooses to purchase on your site(s). Then, you will continuously earn money for each link every month, as long as the link(s) are active. \n\nYour earning per link is based on the Domain Authority of your site, the more authority your site has, the more money you will make! \n\nHow to get started? \n\nThe easiest way to get started is to get yourself registered on Backlinks.com. \n\nIt\u2019s a quite easy and simple process: \n\n\u2022 Sign up with Backlinks.com\n\n\u2022 Insert the code snippet they provide into pages where you\u2019d like to sell links\n\n\u2022 Set any specifications regarding who can buy backlinks from your site\n\n\u2022 Sit back and wait for the money to start rolling in! \n\nTo start making money through backlinks <a href=\"http://www.backlinks.com/signup_pub/\" target=\"blank\">Click Here</a>. \n\nWhat to Avoid? \n\nDon\u2019t be so desperate to make money that you start allowing backlinks from a site that doesn\u2019t create high-quality content. \n\nDon\u2019t get into paid links. They are spammed and lower your SEO success. \n\nBacklinks other than the body of a text i.e. in a sidebar or a footer are not as productive.

There is a shortcut to getting more likes and followers. The problem is\u2026when you buy likes and followers, you\u2019re getting quantity, not quality. Sure, your numbers might look good, but if your audience is just full of robots who say nothing of value, what\u2019s the point?\n\n2. Avoid using poor quality images. Instagram is a visual medium. So if you\u2019re going to post something, it should be beautiful\u2014or at least interesting! \u2014to look at.\n\n3. Figuring out the right number of posts on Instagram or any social media platform, really is a delicate dance: a social soft-shoe, if you will. Too few posts, and you risk looking out of touch, or being forgotten. Too many posts, and you might seem desperate or annoying.\n\n4. Speaking of analytics: another big mistake marketer make on Instagram is to ignore the data. You should be obsessively tracking the metrics that matter so you can identify trends and growth.\n"}, {"name": "Earn through viral websites", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/E-Money-Online/E-Money-Data/main/images/home_100.png", "description": "There are many ways to monetize a website and make money online. One avenue that often gets overlooked is creating viral content that drives thousands of users to your site. This method is one of the easier ways to scale a website and create a recurring income.\n\nViral Content:\n\nViral content is any piece of media that is shared rapidly and widely from one Internet user to another and becomes an online sensation. Viral content can be just about anything, but current news stories, sporting events or amazing nature stories usually work best.\n\nViral website is the one which publishes these content and drive traffic madly.\n\nHow it works?\n\nThere are basically four major steps to earn through this source, which are:\n\n1. Build a website.\n\n2. Create viral content.\n\n3. Set up a Facebook page and promote your content.\n\n4. Monetize traffic using advertisement agencies like Propeller Ads.\n\nWebsite: For building a website, you don\u2019t need coding skills as most platforms today are either drag-and-drop or allow you to install a ready-to-go theme. We suggest using WordPress to build your site as it\u2019s the easiest platform to use and grow your website.

Viral content can be anything interesting, fun, weird, wacky or downright disgusting. Google Trends is a great platform to source topics that are currently trending and being searched by users. Sites such as Upworthy (<a href=\"https://www.upworthy.com/\" target=\"blank\">Visit Now</a>), Reddit(<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/\" target=\"blank\">Visit Now</a>) and BuzzFeed (<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/\" target=\"blank\">Visit Now</a>) are all great resources to find trending stories, too.\n\nFacebook Page: After you\u2019ve set up your website, you\u2019ll need to set up a Facebook page next. They can be created for free and will be your main platform to distribute and promote your viral content through your page, Facebook Adverts Manager and Facebook groups. There are a lot of ways to drive traffic to your Facebook page, but if your website is new, the best way to get people to see your content is to pay for them to see it.\n\nAdvertise Fb page: If you spent $10-20 per day to promote a Facebook ad, then your Facebook page could potentially get thousands of likes and shares every month. As you keep doing this, your Fan page will grow as will the amount of traffic hitting your website.\n\nHere are some of the largest Content Discovery Networks to drive huge number of traffic to your website:Outbrain.com, Taboola.com, Content.Ad, RevContent.com, Disqus.com \n\nMonetization: If successful with your website and Fb page, you\u2019ll be bringing in thousands of website visitors each day, and you\u2019ll want to monetize that traffic. The benefit of driving viral traffic is you can receive huge amounts of traffic within a short period of time doing very little work.\n\n1.

Pay Per Click Advertising (PPC): One of the most common PPC programs is Google Adsense. Google AdSense is a program run by Google through which website publishers in the Google Network of content sites serve text, images, video, or interactive media advertisements. The PPC provider automatically creates ads that are based on the webpage\u2019s content and targeted to your specific audience. You get paid a small commission every time a visitor clicks on one of these ads on your website.\n\n3. Sell Ad Space: If your site gets more than 200,000 views per month, you can consider selling ad space directly. Most of the time, direct ads as sold on a CPM basis which is where a website publisher pays a certain amount for 1,000 impressions on each ad. If you think your website is a good fit for this time of monetization and want to work with ad networks, check out InClick (<a href=\"http://www.inclick.net/index.php\" target=\"blank\">Visit Now</a>) , OpenX (<a href=\"https://www.openx.com/publishers/\" target=\"blank\">Visit Now</a>), or DoubleClick (<a href=\"https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com\" target=\"blank\">Visit Now</a>) from Google.\n\n4. Feature Sponsored Posts: Featuring sponsored posts works best when you have focused on increasing your visitor numbers. One way to feature sponsored content is to do product reviews in an advertorial post on your website.\n\nHow much can you earn?\n\nWe could say that viral websites with a large share of traffic from social networks like Facebook get higher rates than websites with other traffic sources and reach 7 USD per 1000 impressions (including the traditionally \u201chard to monetize\u201d countries). One can earn up to $350 per day from a successfully published website.\n\nWhat to Avoid?\n\n\u2022 If you are thinking of any magic that gives you passive income overnight, then it is not going to happen. What you need to do is take action, be focused and keep moving on consistently.\n\n\u2022 Religion and politics are two subject areas that people feel very strongly about. Whenever you post content that\u2019s overtly political or religious, you\u2019re unlikely to connect with all of your audience, and you're bound to be either irrelevant or offensive to those who don\u2019t share your views.\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s tempting to resort to sharing the latest viral meme when you\u2019re low on time and your social feeds are looking empty. But take care - chances are, your audience has already seen it, and you reposting is only dumbing down the rest of your activity.\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s a time and a place for voicing concerns about your clients or competitors - and it\u2019s not on social media.\n\n\u2022 Making a mistake in your content - either a simple typo or a full-blown grammar gaff - can look as though you don\u2019t care. When you\u2019re drafting your content, make sure you proofread your copy before you publish.\n"}]
